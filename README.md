Traffic Padding Plugin

Traffic padding adds random data to the communication stream to disguise real data patterns, which makes traffic analysis more difficult.
 TrafficPaddingPlugin.java

This plugin generates random dummy data packets at regular intervals, which can be toggled on or off based on user preference.
