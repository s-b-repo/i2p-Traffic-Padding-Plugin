# i2p-Traffic-Padding-Plugin
Traffic Padding Plugin

Traffic padding adds random data to the communication stream to disguise real data patterns, which makes traffic analysis more difficult.
 TrafficPaddingPlugin.java

This plugin generates random dummy data packets at regular intervals, which can be toggled on or off based on user preference.

Integration:

    Add Plugin Class: Save TrafficPaddingPlugin.java under i2p/router/java/plugins.

    Register Plugin: Modify RouterAppManager.java in the net.i2p.router package to include this new plugin during router startup.
